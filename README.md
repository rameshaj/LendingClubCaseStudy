## General Information
- The product will provide insights on loan data
- The background is to use to use various steps involved in EDA for analysing datas
- We used loan.csv file 
- Provide insights on whether to give loan or not

##Technologies Used  - 
  - Python for analysing data
  - Jupyter Notebookss Editor
      
## Conclusions
- Risk Factors Identification: Certain borrower attributes (e.g., lower credit scores, higher debt-to-income ratios) and loan characteristics (e.g., longer terms, larger loan amounts) are associated with increased default risk.
- Targeted Risk Mitigation: By focusing on high-risk borrower segments and adjusting lending criteria accordingly, we can mitigate credit risk and optimize portfolio performance.
- Enhanced Decision-Making: Leveraging predictive models incorporating key risk factors can improve loan underwriting processes and inform strategic decisions in risk management.
